12/31/2019	In Defense of ‘Winging’ your New Years Resolutions	and why you might be sabotaging yourself	87	0	https://medium.com/@sallise	https://medium.com/swlh/in-defense-of-winging-your-new-years-resolutions-ba0df1b2bfc9?source=collection_archive---------77-----------------------	7	6	['In Defense of ‘Winging’ New Year’s Resolutions', 'Do What Feels Good For YOU.', 'Do Less and Do More', 'Start Tiny!', 'Space Things Out.', 'Don’t Be Afraid to Reschedule.']	38	['S. Allise Wilson', 'Follow', 'The Startup', '--', 'Listen', 'Share', 'A new year is coming and everyone is spouting the familiar (and tired) words of “New Year, New You!” Think of future you in 2020, making lists of all the things you want to start doing in the New Year and how important it will be to start it all on day one.', 'This year will be my year!', 'This year will be the one where everything changes!', 'This year is even more special than some of the others because it’s the start of a decade. It’s an even year with repeating digits that will have people far more excited about January 1st, and other matchy dates, than necessary. The presidential election will happen near the end of the year and it’s a century since the 19th amendment was ratified and women were given the right to vote — but maybe we should all slow down for a second. There’s a ton of hype about this year…but what about the year’s past?', 'Now I want you to think about how last year went. You recall starting that gym membership on the first and maybe keeping things up for a month or so before it all went sideways. You started the quest to read 250 books and realized by September you’d only read 2 and gave up. Perhaps you wanted to do something small like getting up a little earlier, but then a few consecutive late nights made that impossible and suddenly coffee was more than a lifeline than before. Or you had a mix of multiple things you wanted to start doing and when one fell apart you trashed it all after a few months and decided you’d “try again” next year.', 'These are the resolutions of year’s past and they all have one thing in common: Something went wrong and then they were abandoned. If not entirely forgotten, they simply haunted you for the rest of the year. Instead of that empowered feeling you chased at the beginning, you feel down on yourself and wonder if it’s even possible to change.', 'Don’t be so hard on yourself. We all do it! Unless you’re one of those people who smash all their resolutions every year. In which case, congrats, but even you might have something to learn from this.', 'So what can you do to make this year different? The old ways didn’t quite work for you for various reasons, but there’s more than one way to skin a cat (or maybe just some other ways to avoid skinning the cat altogether).', 'It turns out that (for the most part) you know yourself best. That doesn’t mean that you won’t try things that look a lot better for someone else. A good example is the year I told myself I’d run a 10k. I believed that being able to do a 10k meant I’d be on my way to a healthier me that year. I’d do a bunch of running and training for a few months and happily accept my medal after I finished the 10k. Easy enough right?', 'Too bad I conveniently forgot how much I hate running.', 'Anyone can make a goal, but you need to look at why you’re making that goal and different ways you can achieve it. If you have a resolution to be healthier, there’s more than one way to do that. I didn’t have to just run to be healthier: I could do yoga, add more veggies during the week, or even just cut back on soda or sweets.', 'There’s more than one way to reach a goal and you’ll be happier if you try a path that feels good to you. It took me going through loads of gym equipment to realize I like cycling and rowing. That doesn’t mean I’m at the gym every day, but at least I know what I enjoy doing when I go.', 'It’s very common for people to want to add a bunch of new things to their plate in the new year. They want to spend more time with family. Some want to go on morning jogs with the dog every day. Others want to travel more during the year. All these things are great! How will all these new things fit in your old schedule?', 'They won’t. At least not on their own.', 'I like to think of it as keeping balanced. There are only so many hours in the week and to fit in all these new goals, you’re gonna have to give up some things. To read more books next year, I’ll have to spend less time on my phone. To paint more pictures, I’m going to have to play fewer video games.', 'To keep this balanced, you have to know what you’re spending your time on. Keep a list of some of the resolutions you have that you could be doing in your free time. Then during the week write down what you’re doing with that time. Are you keeping things balanced? Are you willing to give up Netflix for a few hours to read those 250 books?', 'It also might be helpful to keep track of why you aren’t doing that thing you said you’d do, like in the below article. I know I’m gonna give it a shot this year!', 'forge.medium.com', 'As I said before, I want to paint more in the new year. One habit I have as of late is to sit down and take several hours (in one sitting) to paint one painting. I’d be enthralled in the piece and finish it all at once usually. Once I get started, it’s usually hard to stop. Starting is a completely different beast because when I don’t think I have hours to sit and work on a piece, I won’t even start it.', 'If someone gave you a huge cake — your favorite kind even — and said you didn’t have to share with anyone, how would you eat it? Some might try to eat it all at once and get rid of the evidence, but most of us would cut it into slices and then finish it bite by bite. Ever think of doing that for a goal?', 'Say you want to read more books. You could tell yourself to just read a sentence, just a single sentence, and see how fast you read a book in a week. Same with writing. Decide to write one sentence — no other rules attached — and see where it goes. See how far you get without some beautiful plan or intense schedule. Break those bold plans into tiny steps and see how much quicker they get done than saying you’re going to create a masterpiece all at once.', 'Few people make only one resolution. Usually, there are several. I remember one year I said I was just going to focus on being happier. It was the only goal I made and for that year, I can say I succeeded at that. I didn’t have to knit it around several other plans for that year, so I focused only on that goal.', 'Trying to change multiple things about your routine and life all at once is a guarantee for failure. You’re already going against the grain by doing something different, but then adding a bunch of unfamiliar elements can make it harder to get anything done. Easing things into your routine is supposed to make it more fluid with your day. Your day can get derailed if every day you’re supposed to do 80 new things.', 'That’s why I suggest spreading things out across the year. Wanna take cooking lessons? Maybe take them before you get that new puppy that may eat up all your time for a while. Wanna write a novel? Maybe resolve to start writing a novel after the three months you spent training for that marathon, so you don’t feel bad about not having time or energy to write.', 'All new skills and ideas deserve some time to grow. Sometimes they can’t when you’re trying to create a completely new you the moment January hits.', 'Falling off the horse is the greatest fear of any resolution. You start strong and then a life-changing event happens and you can’t keep up with your new goals at all. For some reason, you lose motivation and just need time to recharge and that’s ok. Just because you took a break, doesn’t mean it needs to end.', 'Many start the year thinking that’s the only time to start a life change, but honestly, who cares? People start new things every day! In a week I may decide to finally learn to play my electric guitar. I may also have to stop in March to help with a friend’s wedding. That doesn’t mean that I need to wait 300 days to make a new attempt.', 'Waiting for the perfect time to start something may take decades or you can just decide to try today. Consistency helps a lot with motivation and reaching goals, yes, but taking a break to check in with yourself is just as important. It’s not the end unless you let it be.', 'I’m not giving up on learning guitar, I know I’ll pick it up again soon. Though I’m also in the process of moving so it might be best to practice in the new place with renewed energy and motivation.', 'Being a bit random with my goals helped me this year. For one, I started writing a graphic novel this year. I’ve chipped at it on and off for most of 2019 and I plan to do more with it next year. I would have never started if I thought it had to be done in a month. I would have never gotten this far if I didn’t write my idea down to start and work on it when I felt a whim.', 'There’s no right or wrong way to accomplish your goals for the year and few journeys are a straight line, start to finish. If your resolutions have been a series of you starting at the beginning of the year and ending in March, maybe it’s time to try a new way to do things? It can’t be “New Year, New You” without you doing it your way.', 'Don’t let 2020 be a repeat of the years before it. Do something, well, new. Let me know about your unusual takes on resolutions and how you might succeed this year over others.']
